## üëã **Hi, I'm Stan!**

I'm a **Senior AI Engineer @IBM** passionate about building robust, scalable, and impactful AI solutions. \
My expertise lies in **Multi-Agent frameworks**, **LLM Fine-Tuning**, **RAG**, and **MCP** protocols, bridging cutting-edge research with real-world applications.

*Most of my work isn't public yet, as I dedicate a significant part of my time to exciting internal projects at IBM.*

### üìà Impact Highlights

- **IBM**: Core developer and Tech Lead of **IBM's Global Agentic Framework** and **Finetuning Framework**:

  - Optimized agent latency and memory for real-time performance.
  - Designed hardware-optimized fine-tuning solutions SFT, DPO, GRPO, LoRaX for edge deployment.
  - Used vLLM, Speculative Decoding, DeepSpeed for fast inference.
  - Co-led InstructLab Europe for synthetic data generation.
  - Solutions deployed in 20+ enterprise use cases:
      - Agentic data scientist: Python-SQL code generation for analysis and viz
      - Agentic CI/CD IDE: Code review via finetuned models & IBM guidelines
      - Agentic due diligence: Automated KYC/DD with Neo4j graphs
      - Agentic customer RAG: Live web scraping + retrieval
    
- **UBS / Credit Suisse**:
  - RAG over million+ legal docs. [Featured by Microsoft Customer Story](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/22961-ubs-ag-azure-ai-search#customers-share-modal-dialog=)
  - Optimized ETL/ML pipelines, achieving 30% compute cost reduction.
  - FinBERT finetuning for NER & classification.
